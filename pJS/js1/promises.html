<!--promises: 
Js is single threaded.This makes it slow and restructive
with the help of promises and other asynchronous concepts.Javascript can perform long network requests simultaneously
without blocking the main thread
A promises is said to be settled when it is either fulilled or rejected.once the promise is settled ,it becomes immutable,and its state cannot change
then(callback):used to attach a callback when the promise is fulfilled
catch(callback):uesd to attach a callback when the promise is rejected
Promise returns a function which takes two parameters resolve and reject-->
