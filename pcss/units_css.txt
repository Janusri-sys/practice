pc,points and pixels(pt,px) among them px is used in web design and web development

relative  is a unit length that is relative to the fontsize or viewport 
em,rem,px,ch,vh

px: 100px=3inch  2.94cm=1inch  
Different boxes have different measurement  CSS units!=realworld measurements
pixel is a anchor unit it is dependent on something called reference pixel(it is a pixel that looks exactly same in all
viewing situations relative to the expected viewing distance of a distance)
em:relative to the font-size of theparent
rem:relative to the font-size of the html root(default-16px)

% are relative to the parent to overcome this we use vw which is independent of parent
